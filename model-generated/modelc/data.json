        Attention:

        Mineral Resources and Energy welcomes the appointment of Jacob Mbele as Director General

        Dear Friend,

        Having consulted with my colleagues Mr. June Williams and based on the information gathered from the Chambers Of Commerce and Industry, I have the privilege to request your assistance to transfer the sum of $47,500,000.00 (Forty-Seven Million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars) into your accounts. The above sum resulted from an over-invoiced contract, executed, commissioned and paid for about five years (5) ago by a foreign contractor. This action was however intentional and since then the fund has been in a suspense account at The Apex Bank, South African Reserve Bank awaiting final payment to any reliable foreign bank account you may provide.

        We are now ready to transfer the fund overseas and that is where you come in. It is important to inform you that as civil servants, we are forbidden to operate a foreign account; that is why we require your assistance. The total sum will be shared as follows: 70% for us, 25% for you and 5% for local and international expenses incidental to the transfer.

        The transfer is risk free on both sides. My colleague Mr. June Williams is an accountant with the Department of minerals and energy company LTD, republic of South Africa. If you find this proposal acceptable, we shall require the following documents:

        (a) Your banker’s name, Address, telephone, account and fax numbers.

        (b) Your private telephone and fax numbers for confidentiality and easy communication.

        (c) Your letter-headed paper stamped and signed.

        Alternatively, we will furnish you with the text of what to type into your letter-headed paper, along with a breakdown explaining, comprehensively what we require of you. The business will take us thirty (30) working days to accomplish.

        Thank you, I am looking forward to hearing from you.

        My best regards,

        Mr. Paul Maroga",

        Dear Recipient,

        I hope this email finds you well. I am contacting you regarding a few funding opportunities that I believe you may be interested in.

        Firstly, I would like to introduce you to Mrs. Maryalice Williams, who is willing to donate $2.7 million dollars to fund volunteer projects in your area. However, due to poor health, Mrs. Williams was unable to provide more details on this initiative. I hope that you can find the time to contact Mrs. Williams directly regarding this donation and ask her for further clarification.

        Secondly, I hope that you will not ignore a donation from the Success Donation Foundation in the amount of $7 million dollars. You are meant to reply to this email directly to claim these funds, and I assure you that this is a safe opportunity that you should not let pass.

        Lastly, I hope that you will consider a business proposal put forward by Mr. Paul Maroga of the Department of Minerals and Energy in South Africa. Mr. Maroga contacted me regarding an over-invoiced contract that was executed, commissioned, and paid for approximately five years ago by a foreign contractor. The funds from this contract, totaling $47,500,000 dollars, have been sitting in a suspense account at The Apex Bank, South African Reserve Bank, and is now awaiting payment to a reliable foreign bank account. Mr. Maroga and his team are looking for assistance from abroad to transfer these funds, as civil servants in South Africa are forbidden to operate foreign accounts. The total sum is to be split into 75% for the South African civil servants and 25% for you, with 0.5% allocated to local and international expenses incidental to the transfer. Mr. Maroga and his team will require the contact information for your bank, as well as your personal contact information to proceed. Please let me know if you would like me to provide more information regarding this proposal.

        Please let me know your response regarding these three opportunities, and I hope to hear from you soon.
