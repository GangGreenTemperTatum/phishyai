      Subject: Business Proposal (Mr. Paul Maroga South Africa)
      From Office of the Director,
      Department of Minerals and Energy
      Project Implementation Unit, Department of Minerals and Energy,
      Trevenna Campus, Building 2C, Cnr Meintjes & Francis Baard Streets, Sunnyside, Pretori
      Republic of South Africa.

      Attention:

      Mineral Resources and Energy welcomes the appointment of Jacob Mbele as Director General

      Dear Friend,

      Having consulted with my colleagues Mr. June Williams and based on the information gathered from the Chambers Of Commerce and Industry, I have the privilege to request your assistance to transfer the sum of $47,500,000.00 (Forty-Seven Million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars) into your accounts. The above sum resulted from an over-invoiced contract, executed, commissioned and paid for about five years (5) ago by a foreign contractor. This action was however intentional and since then the fund has been in a suspense account at The Apex Bank, South African Reserve Bank awaiting final payment to any reliable foreign bank account you may provide.

      We are now ready to transfer the fund overseas and that is where you come in. It is important to inform you that as civil servants, we are forbidden to operate a foreign account; that is why we require your assistance. The total sum will be shared as follows: 70% for us, 25% for you and 5% for local and international expenses incidental to the transfer.

      The transfer is risk free on both sides. My colleague Mr. June Williams is an accountant with the Department of minerals and energy company LTD, republic of South Africa. If you find this proposal acceptable, we shall require the following documents:

      (a) Your banker’s name, Address, telephone, account and fax numbers.

      (b) Your private telephone and fax numbers for confidentiality and easy communication.

      (c) Your letter-headed paper stamped and signed.

      Alternatively, we will furnish you with the text of what to type into your letter-headed paper, along with a breakdown explaining, comprehensively what we require of you. The business will take us thirty (30) working days to accomplish.

      Thank you, I am looking forward to hearing from you.

      My best regards,

      Mr. Paul Maroga",
